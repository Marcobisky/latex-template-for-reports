# Latex Templates for Reports

## Usage

* `CodeFormat`: Configured for `C/C++`, `MATLAB`, `Python`, `bash`
* `latex.hsnips`: This is the snippet file that I use for daily workflow (used in vscode with plugin [HyperSnips for Math](https://github.com/OrangeX4/hsnips)).

Every line is commented for modification.
